The door clicked shut behind him, almost sounding as if had slammed for how disturbingly silent it was in the kings study. Shirou swept his eyes around the office quickly before coming to rest on the figure sitting at her desk. He walked forward slowly, wondering if perhaps King Arthur was taking a break from all of her paperwork, and he was about to greet her when he found himself coming to an immediate halt. The candles on her desktop had long since gone out, and it was hard to tell out her features except for where a small sliver of sunlight hit her just right. Obviously exhausted, her head rested over her left hand, a quill still in her right as shoulders shifted just barely as she breathed in and out slowly. Her eyes were closed, and all signs of her normal stress, concern, and problems were absent from her expression as she rested serenely. The kings tendrils of hair fell over her eyes, waving slightly with each breath she exhaled, and the entire scene made her seem innocent, young, and a complete contrast to her normal countenance. Shirou couldnt help but stare, and when he heard the telltale sound of his dishes sliding, he quickly righted the tray and, taking a single, deep breath, put the tray aside on one of the chairs meant for the kings guests. When his golden-brown eyes peered back at her again, he found that she hadnt moved even the slightest. He couldnt take his eyes off of her. Perhaps he should have been concerned when there was no answer at the very first knock hed made to her door. King Arthur was not an intentionally rude person - if she was busy, she would simply ask him to come at a different time. But, then again there were times when she was so deep into her work, that she just didnt hear any outside influences. Those times were rare, but still happened every now and then. Actually, it had happened just last week, if he recalled correctly. That time, Shirou had stood outside of the office for at least ten minutes before trying again, and she was certain to apologize about the incident. When the second knock and call went unanswered, that waved a few red flags that had him narrowing his eyes a bit. Maybe she simply wasnt in her office? But the king was always in her office at the ass crack of dawn, and he wouldve received a notification from that steward of hers, whatever the hell his name was, otherwise. The steward was nothing if not prompt and quick to inform. At the third knock and call, Shirou finally realized that there mightve been something wrong on her end, and he took a cautious step back. It was probably unnecessary of him to do so, but he immediately thought up the number of things that could have gone wrong: she had Avalon, so that shouldnt have been an issue; it was a closed-quartered room, without any breaches that hed noticed, which was another thing to dismiss; any signs of struggle wouldve been noticed by the guards standing at the sides of her door; he was in charge of everything she ate, but that was still negated by Avalon, which made it a moot point; could something have come in through the window - a sleeping gas, maybe? But, to Shirous knowledge, that hadnt technically been invented yet.So, when he had made his way inside, ready for the worst, the sight of her like...this, froze him to the core. Even during his time with Saber, when had he ever really seen her look so relaxed, so calm, so...small and sweet? The time she had been meditating in his houses dojo couldnt compare. The time she had lain in the room next to his to conserve energy, couldnt compare. Not even their night together could compare to how she seemed now. Excepting the last example, the woman had been ready to take on the world if need be - she would have launched from her meditational pose to her feet in a heartbeat, from the realm of sleep to an attacking stance in less than a second. But her, right now? Certainly, she could, but...it was different. This was her safe haven, in her castle, in her territory, her time, surrounded by her people, who would jump to protect her at the cost of their lives. It was different, and he knew it. Even if she didnt trust everyone, even if she were wary of problems within her haven, it was still her home, not a battlefield where she had to protect her idiot Master. Shirou forcibly cast down his gaze before involuntarily zeroing back in on her again. His feet taking him closer to her desk, Shirou couldnt help but continue to stare. His thoughts always pushed him back towards his time with Saber, towards their two weeks together, whenever he saw the king. Never had Shirou regretted letting her go at the end of the war - she hadnt belonged in his time, in a place among the living. He never regretted saying goodbye, but he had wished they couldve done more, couldve had the chance to experience other things. Shirou remembered her expressions of happiness during parts of their date, remembered her joy over finding something new to take interest of. Now, as his mind told him to stop and think about what the hell he was doing, he still felt himself leaning down, a hand gently, and gingerly brushing aside tendrils of her bangs. And, as his heart pounded in his chest, and his head telling him, Damn it, Shirou, no!, he bent down towards her. I love you, Saber, was what he had wanted to say, but the second his fingers left her skin, and her eyes flickered open slowly, Shirou had launched back away from her desk with speed he hadnt known hed possessed, his heart having leapt into his throat as he watched her stare ahead of herself absently. He hugged the wall behind him, staring with heavy trepidation as King Arthur groaned softly and slowly rose from her uncomfortable position on her desk. Her left hand massaged her neck as her gaze swept over the paperwork left to be done."},"Characters":[{"Name":"","CharacterSprites":[{"Name":"","Path":"/bingoadventure/Images/Characters/blank.gif"}]},{"Name":"Arthuria","CharacterSprites":[{"Name":"Sleeping","Path":"/bingoadventure/Images/Characters/Saber/Sleeping.png"},{"Name":"angry","Path":"Images/Characters/Saber/angry.png"}]}]}]}]}');
