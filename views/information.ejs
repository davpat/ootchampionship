						The goal for OCS is to have a way for newer players to enjoy big challenge races 
						<br />where they have to think and route on the fly but without having to do some crazy research to figure out obscure strats. 
						<br /><br />
						At the same time, it is a good place for experienced <br />players to have good healthy competition.

					The first season was a success and featured some of the biggest OoT races in the last few years. 
					The second installment will continue in the path of the first one and try to bring new original and fun ways to race the game. 
					This is not your regular No IM/WW race to get SRL points, this is to determine who is the best all-around Ocarina of Time player!

						The format for the regular season will have a couple changes. 
						First of all, there will be 12 races in total instead of 10. 
						The season will be separated in 4 quarters of 3 races.  
						The races will be on every Sunday at 3PM EDT and there will be a week off in between quarters.

						The playoffs will be completely different this time around. <br />
						The 16 players that finish with the most points at the end of the 12 races will qualify for the playoffs and will compete in a double elimination bracket. <br />
						This bracket will be seeded according to their season ranking (1vs16, 2vs15 etc). <br />
						Now this is not any ordinary OoT tournament, these races will be 2 out of 3 and the players will pick and counterpick what they will be racing out of 6 different battle modes.  More information on this will come as the season progresses but a lot more people will qualify for the playoffs this time! <br />
