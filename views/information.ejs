				The goal for OCS is to have a way for newer players to enjoy big challenge races 
				<br />where they have to think and route on the fly but without having to do some crazy research to figure out obscure strats. 
				<br /><br />
				At the same time, it is a good place for experienced <br />players to have good healthy competition.
