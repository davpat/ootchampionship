						Both players strike battle modes until only one is left.
						The higher seed gets to decide who strikes first. <br />The match is then played.<br />
					<strong/>
				<h3/>
				<h2>
					<strong>Game 2:<strong/>
				</h2>
				<h3>
					<strong>The loser of the first match gets to counterpick any of the remaining 5 battle modes.<br /><strong/>
				<h3/>
				<h2>
					<strong>Game 3 (if necessary):<strong/>
				</h2>	
				<h3>
					<strong>The loser of the second match gets to counterpick any of the remaining 4 battle modes.<br /><br /><strong/>

					<strong>
							Winners Finals, Losers Finals and Grand Finals will be best of 5. <br /><br />

				<h3>
					<strong>
						The bracket will be double elimination meaning if you lose a set, you go to the losers bracket. <br /><br />

						The matches do not need to be played all at once. You do not need to officially announce your counterpick in advance. Once you meetup with your opponent at the time you set for your match and both players are ready, the person who counterpicks can officially announce their pick. The race must then start in the next 5 minutes.<br /><br /> 

						Every scheduled match must have a referee be there for at least the start of the race. The referees for now will be the OCS staff (WTHH, Senn, Davpat, Prettybigjoe, MikeKatz45).<br /><br />

						The goal for OCS is to have a way for newer players to enjoy big challenge races 
						<br />where they have to think and route on the fly but without having to do some crazy research to figure out obscure strats. 
						<br /><br />
						At the same time, it is a good place for experienced <br />players to have good healthy competition.

						The races will be on every Sunday at 3PM EDT <br /> and there will be a week off in between quarters.
