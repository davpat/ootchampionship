									Chris goes for swordless aqua escape, Hyperion gets sword and goes for aqua escape. <br /><br />							
									Hyperion buys a bean, but Chris ignores them. <br /><br />
									Hyperion 1 / Chris 1
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									They both enter Kakariko and immediately go for bottle. Chris ignores botw after getting the bottle and goes directly to ToT, buying the hylian shield on the way.<br /><br />
									Hyperion enters botw and goes for both shields, then proceeds to do actor glitch to get to dead hand, kills it, obtains lens which are 2 points and then performs vine clip, obtaining bombchus.<br /><br />
									Chris does swordless dot skip on his first try meanwhile Hyperion is exiting Kakariko.<br /><br />
									Hyperion -2 / Chris -7
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
						
									As soon as Chris enters the Light Medallion cutscene, Hyperion grabs the master sword. <br /><br />
									Hyperion -3 / Chris -5
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									18 minutes in, Chris is exiting ToT while Hyperion enters the light medallion cutscene.<br /> 	 The most notable things are that Chris skipped sword and explosives and hyperion got lens of truth and well chus.<br /><br />

									Chris goes directly to Kakariko in order to start the rba sequence, he then gets the fish on the grotto, the 20 rupee chest and does savewarps. Hyperion is playing again when Chris leaves the Market area.<br /><br />

									Chris RBA’s empty bottle and poe while waiting for day. Hyperion is starting the RBA sequence by then. Chris RBA’s pocket cucco and cojiro with fish.<br /><br />

									Chris -9  / Hyperion  -4
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									While Chris is racing Dampe, Hyperion is waiting for daylight after RBA’ing third bottle and poe. Chris gets a 50 seconds Dampe. Meanwhile Hyperion is getting cojiro, RBA’ing the same things that Chris did.

									No mistakes so far for both parts.

									Chris -9  / Hyperion  -7
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									Chris enters shadow temple via hookshot jump, hover boots are worth the negative points, he affirms. Meanwhile, hyperion is racing dampe.<br /><br />

									After hyperion gets a 56 dampe, Chris leaves the graveyard, farms 15 bombs, then proceeds to play the archery minigame for quiver 40, first try. 
									After that, he kills the redeads inside the kakariko grotto and gets a golden rupee. Hyperion is seamwalking on its way to shadow temple.<br /><br />

									Seems like they are both doing exactly the same so far with little differences on the items they got as child! <br /><br />

									Chris -12  / Hyperion -11
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									Chris continues his way to DMT, almost getting the hess all the way up to Goron City. Then proceeds to buy giant’s knife, which is worth 4 points. Save the bombs, he claims, while picking up bomb flowers. <br /><br />

									Hyperion is getting song of storms after leaving shadow while chris gets the goron tunic. First try statue pull cancel for Chris! After this, Chris performs deathless bolero while Hyperion exits the windmill and goes to the shooting range to get his quiver 40!<br /><br />

									Chris -7 / Hyperion -10
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									Hyperion forgets the 200 rupees while going up to DMT! First mistake by him.

									Chris is going for minuet doing a megaflip over mido and Down A minuet skip, after this, he trades cojiro for odd mushroom.

									We are on the 40 minutes mark, Chris just voided out for minuet while Hyperion enters Goron City. 

									Chris -4  / Hyperion -8
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									Stop spinning! Says Chris to the wolfos in the SFW grotto. Remember that spin the wheel was the first banned mode for this duel.

									Chris gets the odd mushroom while hyperion finishes talking to the goron, which name is RQ (Rage Quit) For the tunic. Then proceeds to buy giant’s knife.

									Hyperion goes for death bolero skip using a bomb, no risks taken. Meanwhile, Chris gets 2 heart pieces on his way back to kakariko, then, buys blue potion, which is worth 4 points.

									Chris finally reaches a positive score after becoming an adult! 

									Chris 1  / Hyperion -3
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									While Chris is cleaning kakariko HP’s, Hyperion succeeds on death minuet skip. Chris is now ready to focus on the card objectives, but, hold on! Hyperion is also done with the rba sequence (for now)! They both head to Gerudo Valley at the same time! 

									Chris 1  / Hyperion 0
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									Chris fails the hess to skip gerudo valley gap 4 times while hyperion gets the 2 bomb superslide on his first try. Hyperion enters Gerudo Fortress while Chris forces himself to do the mega sidehop jump. Close match!

									They both go for gerudo card! They both go for the same prisoners route!  However Hyperion goes for torch method and Chris goes for nut + isg strat, using giant’s knife jump slash stored damage.

									Hyperion takes the lead when entering the second prisoner, they both continue with their prefered strat for beating the gerudo guards down. Chris giant’s knife is slowing taking the lead over Hyperion.

									They both take the ground jump shortcut!

									</div>
									

									Oh no! Chris fails to stun the guard with nuts, he equips MS back to crouch stab her while Hyperion heads to the last guard. They are amazingly arguing on the same time that, besides having similar points, they are doing completely different things, what a race!
									53 minutes in, perfect fortress for Hyperion and a bit sloppy for Chris, Hyperion gets gerudo card sooner than Chris.

									Hyperion 10  / Chris 11
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									Hyperion enters GTG using SVA’s clip, which requires no items at all if you didn’t know, then, gets the weirdshot to ice arrows unbuffered on his first try! Chris decides to pay in order to enter GTG. Chris struggles a bit with the weirdshot but finally gets it, then proceeds to get the bombchus he didn’t get as child, struggling even more on the second weirdshot, but finally getting it.


									It’s time to cross the desert! Hyperion opens the gerudo gate and crosses the wasteland with hover boots, safety and steady. 

									As soon as hyperion enters desert colossus, Chris ground jumps over the tower of the fortress to skip opening the gate!

									Chris is not as safe as Hyperion, after failing 1 time, gets half wasteland hess. Hyperion is now watching requiem, which will give him the first goal of the countdown, that is 15 points!

									Chris decides to farm a bit of bombs inside spirit but gets unlucky, meanwhile, Hyperion is hovering up to mirror shield, he won’t get hit by the guay at any cost! Hyperion gets silver gauntlets which is worth 4 points! 

									Chris 28 / Hyperion 34
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									Requiem and Silver Gauntlets cutscenes playing at once. Oh no! Hyperion is low on bombs and needs to farm from the rocks!

									<div class="text-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ModernAwkwardPeafowlAllenHuhu&autoplay=false&tt_medium=clips_embed" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>										
									</div>

									Hyperion superslides to mirror shield while Chris is doing spirit hover. Chris opens the silver gauntlets chest and Hyperion the mirror shield chest at the exact same time! This is the kind of race we expect from 2 top players. 

									Hyperion realizes he can’t get Nayru’s love and plays minuet to leave the area, meanwhile, Chris superslides to mirror shield and enters spirit temple from the main entrance.

									Hyperion is now trading cojiro for odd mushroom, time is pushing really hard, 1 hour in, it’s really close! 

									Chris 39  / Hyperion 37
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									Chris gets his hylian shield eaten by the like like, gaining 5 points! Hyperion is getting the odd potion from the hex shop. Chris leaves spirit temple and savewarps. Hyperion needs to farm a little bit for blue potion on the kakariko grotto. Did you know that bee panels drops 5 rupees if you hit them with the hookshot?

									Hyperion goes back to the colossus! He realized he can get his shield eaten by a like like! Meanwhile, Chris fails his salesman exam, selling their bugs instead of his fish! They both seem to be doing random things on the way, getting some skulls, some hearts… They realize they have so much time for the rest of the objectives they want.

									They are both going for requiem, zora tunic and 3 tunics and 3 boots. However, Chris is ahead on points right now.


									Chris plays minuet and Hyperion bolero at the same time. Chris enters forest temple to farm some skulltulas meanwhile Hyperion forgets he already got minuet and backtracks to goron city from lost woods, what a mistake!

									Chris just got his 3rd skull in forest temple, skipping the basement one. Hyperion is getting the golden rupee in goron city. Chris leaves the forest temple.

									Hyperion finally marks the real items he was lazy to mark! Chris is getting the fairy on SFW which is worth 1 point!

									Chris 48 / Hyperion 43
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									As soon as Hyperion enters Zora’s Domain, he clips through the ladder and leads to Lake Hylia.. What is Hyperion doing? Chris is farming bombs on Kokiri forest, getting also some skulls. What Hyperion is doing in his home, water temple? Can you guess it by watching this clip?

									<div class="text-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BoringCulturedPoultrySoBayed&autoplay=false&tt_medium=clips_embed" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>		
									</div>
									
									Hyperion deleted his Master Sword! Worth 1 point!

									Chris gets some HPs in zora’s river, unfortunately, it’s day and he cannot get the skulltulas. Hyperion leaves water temple playing minuet while Chris enters Zora’s domain.

									Almost 10 minutes to go! Chris unfreezes king zora using a trade item while hyperion gets the fairy that Chris got 5 minutes ago in the same place. Luckily for hyperion, it is night so he can get some skulls on his way to ice cavern.

									Chris is entering Jabu as adult! Gets it first try! 10 minutes is way too much for these players!

									<div class="text-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=StylishKindWatercressFailFish&autoplay=false&tt_medium=clips_embed" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
									</div>

									While Hyperion is finding out how to unfreeze king zora, Chris gets the 2 skulls in Jabu Jabu’s Belly. 

									Chris 78 / Hyperion 72
									<br />
									<hr style="background-color: black; height: 1px; border: 0; ">
									Ice cavern is the final trial! Freezard clip by Chris first try! Hyperion is struggling a bit with the ice blocks to enter the cavern while chris is BEING an ice block, these keese…

									<div class="text-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=VastDoubtfulLapwingTF2John&autoplay=false&tt_medium=clips_embed" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>									
									</div>
									
									Hyperion goes for ledge clip to compass room and struggles a bit to remove the ice block.

									<div class="text-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AmusedAbstemiousReindeerThunBeast&autoplay=false&tt_medium=clips_embed" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

									ZFG’s ice cavern hess is nothing compared to what Chris did

									<div class="text-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=PlausibleColorfulTrollDancingBaby&autoplay=false&tt_medium=clips_embed" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>									
									</div>
									The final judgement is coming! They are both on ice cavern, going to get iron boots, which will give them 15 points for the 3 swords 3 boots goal and 5 points for the iron boots itself. However, if they get serenade, they will lose points, so they need to not advance the iron boots text and wait until the 1h 30 mins mark is over!

									Chris decides to kill some time out, waiting for the end.

									<div class="text-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
										<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=EagerZanyAnacondaDuDudu&autoplay=false&tt_medium=clips_embed" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>			
									</div>

									Chris gets 100 points after opening the chest. But, hold on! The beast is coming around! Hyperion slowly enters the wolfos room at 81 points! Gets the iron boots! Hyperion is on 101 points just when the time finishes!


									Hyperion gets his first win on the OCS playoffs! It was a close match, that one point that Hyperion got removing the master sword, that 2 points that Chris missed by not buying the beans… The real spirit of countdown, every decision you make will outcome in a different result! 

									Chris 100 / Hyperion 101

									There were also multiple ways of obtaining the boss key. The easiest of them was Din's Fire, which was the method Marco used. Again, it was a bit slower to get the spell, but this way made this whole segment a lot easier. 
									<br /><br />
									You could also do a precise hover over the spikes to get to the chest but you would still have to leave the room before getting crushed which meant savewarping out or using Farore's Wind. Weirdshotting the boss key chest would also work but would have the same problem of having to leave the room.
									<br /><br />
									Lastly, all you had to do was to kill Bongo Bongo while dodging all his attacks. Some people got the Heart Container but they all realized as they were doing it that there was no point!
