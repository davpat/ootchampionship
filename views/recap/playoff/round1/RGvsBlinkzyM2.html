           But, which are their weakest points? Hard to tell, but i can point out the following.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Although RG knows almost every aspect of the game mechanics (including room shapes!) He barely has time to keep up with the new tricks and setups found, so he always attempts to use old school strats.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I didn’t really analyse Blinkzy, but he has for sure less knowledge of the game than RG, despite having the strats up to date (We will later see that this statement is false)
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In conclusion, i think both players are really close to each other in terms of execution in general. RG has knowledge about stuff that nobody knows about (We need to remember that RG chose Spin the wheel in the first match, mostly because of that) But blinkzy is probably more confident about using new strats and tricks.
           <br/>
           <br/>

         <h3 class="text-center">
          <strong>
           Let’s move on to this race in particular. We came here after RG winning the previous race, which was about getting all maps and compasses of the game, one of the possible goals that the wheel can deliver.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The last race was really close, both players finished with less than a minute of difference! It is now time for Blinkzy to choose the battle mode.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           What will Blinkzy pick? Let’s analyse the options…
           <br/>
           <br/>
           1. Bingo: If Blinkzy wants to secure the victory, he definitely needs to avoid Bingo. They are both very consistent with their times. However, blinkzy usually scores better than RG so it is not that bad choice after all.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           2. Categories: We need to remember than Blinkzy banned categories during the first pick. Personally, i think Blinkzy is a bit favored with categories, RG has not ran any of the available ones in a while.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           3. Draft: This is where game knowledge and decision making makes RG better than Blinkzy. RG has a strong experience on the drafting stage in both normal oot and beta quest. Knowing all the relations between goals is crucial for a good picking. I believe Blinkzy won’t go for this counter pick at all.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           4. Short Lockout: Again, strategy is what short lockout is about. I don’t think any of them owns a great knowledge about child tricks and child bingo cards, this fact makes me believe that both players will attempt to avoid short lockout. Remember that RG banned this mode on the first match in the first place. Child bingos usually require contortion hovers, bomb hovers, precise superslides… Most of the crucial things can be made consistent using pause buffer, but neither of them play on VC.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           5. Countdown: A trade off option for Blinkzy, RG hates countdowns, or at least, achieved a bad place in the OCS countdown race, which also was his first and last countdown up to date. Countdowns require a lot more of routing and time planning than execution, things that usually come with the experience. I personally believe Blinkzy is favored on this battle mode because, most likely, RG didn’t practise it at all.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It’s really hard to tell from my point of view what Blinkzy will pick, what does RG think about?
           <br/>
           <br/>

           </div>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           If i was Blinkzy, i would go for Countdown first, bingo second, and categories third.

           It’s bingo time! The intro cutscene is over and both players exit Link’s house!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           They both head directly to the crawl space, they’re going to open the Kokiri Sword chest. RG is still thinking about the lines he’s going to pick when he enters the kokiri shop. Meanwhile, blinkzy already escaped the forest from lost woods!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Seems like RG is going for botw chus and Blinkzy is going straight adult, we will see how it turns… Blinkzy got the WESS to Kakariko while RG got forest escape from Lost Woods using a deku stick on the first try!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           “I think i’m gonna switch to row 4, it looks really good” RG.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           On a bingo, you usually have the intro cutscene time to think about your line. However, usually, multiple lines share the same beginning, so you can postpone choosing it a bit if you are not sure at all.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Blinkzy gets the bottle while RG collected 3 cuccos inside the shack! As we predicted, Blinkzy immediately leaves Kakariko and heads to the Market area, the master sword awaits… At the time Blinkzy enters Temple of Time, RG gets the bottle!

           RG decides to skip botw, while he exits Kakariko and heads to the ToT. Blinkzy just got Master Sword while RG is about to enter the Market. It seems like both players are going after Row 4. RG skips DoT on his second try and grabs the Master Sword! We can talk a bit about this special Row 4 while they are planning their routes.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Hold on, isn’t spooky mask a child goal? Why did they go straight adult? Well, let me present you ass chest, a glitch that lets you open… A special kind of chest, which contains a spooky mask on version 1.0 and 1.2 of the game. You can check ZSR for more information about this glitch.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           What else? Fill 4 bottle slots can be done via RBA. You can get a bottle in the 3rd slot if you RBA empty bottle. You can also get also a bottle on the 2nd slot if you RBA nayru’s love. And finally, you get a bottle in the 4th bottle slot if you RBA red potion. In conclusion, you only need one real bottle for filling the 4 slots!

           Blinkzy savewarps and leaves ToT, heads directly to Kakariko and gets the pocket egg. After that, heads to the graveyard, gets shield and savewarps. By that time, RG just finished the MS cutscene and rushes to Kakariko.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It seems like RG got baited into doing Row 4 by Blinkzy. Blinkzy switched to Col 4 after the MS cutscene.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Blinkzy is doing the 4 Market area skull. That goal requires back in time because you need song of storms. Interesting enough, the 3ds version of the game can wrong warp to the market grotto as adult. After exiting ToT for the second time, Blinkzy enters the Castle and gets the first out of the 4 skulls in the Market, also making it night!

           They both RBA’d poe and empty bottle, which gave them chus and an extra bottle. It is daylight for Blinkzy, he is walking confidently to the party house (named after OCS) In order to wake up Talon. Waking up Talon is required for getting cojiro from the cucco lady!

           Blinkzy heads to Goron City and buys the Giant’s Knife after leaving DC. After that he takes the shortcut to Lost Woods and gets a fish inside the grotto, which will be used for the Forest Medallion cutscene skip.
