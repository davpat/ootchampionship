           2 new school players are facing each other on the first round of the playoffs! They are Scaramangado and Tob3000, we going to refer them as Scara and Tob for now on.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           If you didn’t know, these 2 players started their oot speedrunning career on RG’s rookie bingo tournament. Now, almost 2 years later, they are competing for the first place in the OCS tournament!

           The race starts! We reveal the card and we see the objectives. Remember that players are not allowed to go adult on a short lockout, if one of they claims a goal, the other player can’t claim it. The first to reach 13 points wins.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           A lockout is like a chess game, every move you make matters. You need to be aware of what your opponent might be doing or going for.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The card has fast, normal and slow goals. Getting both skulltulas in lost woods is a fast one, while winning a bombchu bowling prize is a hard one, because it requires more items and time.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara is on VC and Tob on emulator, the differences of the versions also matter in a certain way.

           The intro cutscene is over! Both players head directly to the sword, collecting some rupees, An unintended backflip for Tob puts Scara on the top! They both rush to lost woods after getting the sword.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara struggles a bit with the jump slash clip aqua escape while Tob gets it first try! Tob just got the WESS to kakariko while Scara is buying a bean!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Safety pause for Scara, in order to get the WESS, no, he is able to get it unbuffered, he just wants to make sure he gets into Kakariko before night.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tob, the robot, is analysing cucco trajectories accurately, finally getting his bottle on the 9:22 mark! Tob gets the bugs and savewarps while Scara is collecting the last cucco. It’s a 10:14 bottle for Scara.

           Fast goals are worth 1 point, exactly the same as Slow goals. Tob knows it, he goes for advanced graph theory and decides to get the last skulltula of Lost Woods in the first place, then he gets the bridge one, accomplishing his first goal!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Meanwhile, Scara read correctly his errors and went for botw, getting there 2 shields! But Tob quickly recovers the lead, buying the deku stick upgrade from lost woods!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara is still on the well, going for chus. Tob is opening some chests in kokiri forest, getting some big money, to buy the necessary deku shield.

           While Scara is beating dead hand, Tob is talking to Mido about doing some business in deku tree, we suspect Tob is going for the map &amp; compass, maybe wrong warp. Blue fire is a goal as well.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           After more than 10 pause buffers, Scara vine clips using the Skulltula in botw and gets chus! Tob is rushing the vines of deku tree to the compass room after getting the map.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Both players know what each other is doing! Marking goals immediately reveals your position, but also secures points.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tob gets his 3rd point while getting the compass in deku tree! Meanwhile, Scara had to wait  for night in kakariko, he wants the 7 skulls, which is also a goal!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tob is going after Gohma! After breaking the f1 web, he gets a skulltula, and, after struggling a bit, gets the b1 skip jump! Scara just finished collecting some of the skulls in Kakariko and heads to the graveyard.

           Superslide teleport with bombchus is less frustrating if you buffer, but Scara fails it anyway. Tob just killed Gohma with double ko! Second try is fine, scara gets the graveyard skulls.

           Scara gets his second goal (7 kak skulls) While tob is setting up the wrong warp! Tob won’t use the wall as initial wrong warp setup at any cost! Backflips from the gohma door and performs OI! Consistency is the key, wrong warp to Ganon’s Castle successfully accomplished!

           Holding an objective is the art of not claiming a goal after you get it. Now that Tob is on ganon’s castle, and he knows Scara was on kakariko, it might be a good idea to hold the blue fire goal after getting it, so Scara could think about going for it, wasting time on the process.

           After getting spirit trial chus, Tob is doing some math with his bottles. Scara abandoned the forest and went to Goron City, just to leave immediately and heading to Dodongo’s Cavern!

           <br/>
           Tob gets the bottled fairy from the hidden passage on Ganon’s Castle but runs out of bottles for blue fire! What will he do? Well, he will RBA an new bottle!  Tob gets blue fire!

           While the princess gives Tob her precious secret, Scara is being scammed by the magic beans guy. We need to remember the audience that Scara already planted a bean on DMC, so he needs to buy a total of 8 if he wants to get the 7 beans goal. Simple math!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Does Tob think Scara got gerudo card and keys? Does Scara think Tob got Beat Jabu Jabu belly? It seems like Tob is going for… God knows why. We know Scara is farming rupees in kakariko grotto to be able to buy more beans.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Oh no! Tob beat all 3 child bosses and now he can’t enter the market without watching the zelda escape cs! What a twist of events! Tob superslides to the desert area, he needs to! What an outcome!
