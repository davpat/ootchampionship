           The second match is about to begin! Scara is facing a great challenge. Tob still has a chance if he loses.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           On the previous match, short lockout was played, resulting in a 13 - 9 in favour of Tob. It is now Scara’s turn to counter pick any race mode between the 5 remaining ones!

          <strong>
           Will it be categories? We need to admit that Tob is pretty polyvalent on any mode, but we never saw Tob doing any kind of RTA, maybe he didn’t stream any of them? On the other hand, Scara did perform certain RTA categories in the past, like glitchless, no wrong warp, 37 water temple keys...
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Will it be bingo or draft? This battle mode is, trust me, both player strongest points. I believe that Scara will avoid going for it since Tob usually scores better times on those than him.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Will it be countdown? Tob scored way better than Scara on the OCS countdown. Despite that, Tob banned countdown on his first banning pick. Is Tob afraid of it for some reason?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Finally, Spin the Wheel is the last option. If you want my opinion, although both players have a really deep knowledge of the game, i personally think Tob is better than Scara on this mode because (he plays on emulator) He is better on performing tricks in general.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           If i was Scara, i would go, first for categories, second for spin the wheel and third for countdown, let’s see how it goes…

           The draft starts! While the intro cutscene is playing, both players are thinking about their routes. Let’s summarize the objectives for both of them:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara has a lot of child goals because he decided to go for back in time (Defeat Phantom Ganon) He claims that will practically do all his child goals on child 2. He can choose between getting ZL or not (5 skulls in water temple is doable with iron boots)
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tob, by the other hand, has a lot of stuff on the desert area, and also needs ZL for all 5 shadow keys. However, the only child goal for Tob is wasteland skulls, so he could get requiem as child.
           <br/>

           The intro is over and Scara just went offline! Hopefully we recover the connection. Scara just exited Lost Woods using aqua escape while tob just bought his shield and went for pokey escape! Only Tob got the sword, Scara bought a stick.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara failed the WESS to kakariko while Tob gets to escape the forest on his 4th try! Ocarina cutscene for Tob. Cucco collecting for Scara.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara realizes he can get hammer via BA and totally skip Fire Temple! Cucco gathering sharpens your mind! But wait…

           Tob gets his bottle and directly enters BOTW while Scara fails DoT skip once again. It is a buffering hell for Scara but finally manages to go through, the Master Sword Cutscene awaits… Tob went on flash mode and he already got bombchus, gets the compass afterwards and leaves botw immediately.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tob got 1 boot, 1 shield and 1 compass so far. Scara got a headache trying to think about door of time. Tob heads to the desert area as fast as he can!

           If you believe that Tob method for skipping the gate is way better than the megaflip one, you probably didn’t try it during the day. The guards can catch you if you stand over the fence on your foot. However the megaflip method secures you won’t get caught by forcing link to grab the edge.

           As we suspected, Tob enters and immediately exits Spirit Temple, triggering the requiem cutscene. Scara is waiting for day in Hyrule Field just after RBA’ing empty bottle and bombs.

           Scara trades cojiro for odd mushroom in the Lost Woods while rechecking the RBA tables, then enters the LW grotto and gets a fish. Scara then heads to Kakariko via Mountain area.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Time for everything, Scara. He enters DC while having the mushroom timer on. He probably wants the skull (1 skull of each child dungeon is a goal) He could also get the fake bomb bag for Water Temple keys, will he get it?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tob just finished watching the Master Sword CS and he is now heading to the river on Hyrule Field. Scara got his skull (Staircase skull) And now exits DC!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           While Tob is RBA’ing his 3rd bottle slot and more bombchus, Scara makes it in time to deliver the mushroom. Hold on, where did Tob get cojiro from? If you didn’t remember, Tob got odd mushroom as child from the fortress. After savewarping or dying, the mush turns back to cojiro!

           They are both on the graveyard right now. Scara is setting up for hookshot jump and Tob’s  going for the hookshot itself. At the time Tob gets a 47 Dampe, Scara is on Shadow Temple.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara needs hover boots for his 3 boots goal while Tob needs 5 keys in shadow temple. However, Tob needs ZL to achieve that so he leaves the graveyard after farming some bombs. Scara finishes dead hand off, gets hover boots, and leaves Shadow.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Do you realize how did Tob play his cards? By getting the mushroom and requiem as child, he skipped the first part of the trading sequence while also getting requiem, well played sir.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           We can also say that, if Scara finally manages to skip having to get hammer on Fire Temple, it will also be a great play. Let’s see how this ends up.

           Tob wins with a time of 1 hour 48 minutes and 55 seconds! Both players pretty well in average, used a good route and decided well. However, Scara did one big mistake, which was, entering Jabu. I believe if he got Jabu first try things should’ve been way closer. For his part, Tob is Tob, all the mistakes that Tob did on this race are literally clipped on this page. Not a single mistake that Tob did cost him a lot of time, that was his key to victory.

           Scara kept playing so we can show off what his master plan meant to be. He opened Door of Time as adult via RBA’ing song of time. He then deposited his “master bottle” (bottle on b) and performed back in time. When he went adult again, he had the hammer on the B button which allowed him to kill volvagia without going through Fire Temple.
