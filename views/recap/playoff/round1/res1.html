           We are getting countdown again on the first matchup! Ama knows Gombill that dominates bingo so he banned all the possible bingo battle modes! For his part, Gombill didn’t want to go crazy, so he banned spin the wheel plus categories, one of Ama specialities.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Gombill writes 'AMASUX' as a filename before the race starts, he seems too confident about it!

           Filename is RH

           The card was wrong, a 55 minutes one was generated instead of 1h30m! Referee please...

           The race starts! The golden race, if you didn’t noticed. We have a card with a lot of spirit, a lot of water temple, a bit of shadow and other stuff like shields, swords and blue potion.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Mirror shield is a goal worth 2 objectives and is also worth 8 points, so juicy! We can also see how odd mushroom is worth a lot (9) but you can’t get blue potion without trading it, what will the players do?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Ama and Gombill both head to the crawlspace immediately, getting the sword. That is a negative point. Ama buys the shield and crouch stabs the wall, it’s time for the ocarina cutscene, worth another point. Gombill goes for aqua escape and WESSes its path to Kakariko before ama exits the woods!

           Ama fails the bridge WESS to Kakariko, no problem though, he makes it in before night. Meanwhile, Gombill finishes gathering cuccos and gets the bottle, picks bugs from the rocks and… No! This is not old any%, Gombill heads to temple of time!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Gombill buys the shield from the shop while Ama is about to slash the cucco, speed up, chicken! It’s time for DoT skip for Gombill, will he get it first try?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           C-up strats! The angle is bad though, Gombill gets to clip unbuffered on his second try! The master sword cutscene awaits… Ama is now on botw, getting bombchus using the ocarina dive method, first try. Hold on! Bombchu clip, oh no, he got stuck and fell down to the basement! Ama tries it again! Fails to the basement again! Lens of truth is worth 1 point but Ama finally decides to give up…

           <br/>
           <br/>
           Ama left the countdown page, which by the way didn’t even start the timer, so we are a bit lost about scores, we will only report Gombill.

           <br/>
           <br/>
           Gombill farms some explosives and races dampe, it’s a 54! Ama decides vibruto is not spectacular enough so he decides to put link on top of the chest instead, getting the boomerang afterwards. Gombill the hookshot at the same time!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           30 minutes in, this race has taken different decisions and routes, Ama is still a child and Gombill is farming bombs as much as he can on dampe pots.

           Mega sidehop bridge skip first try for Gombill, time to rush to the fortress. By the way, SVA also found the clip Gombill just did to enter GTG with hover boots, do you know why i always fail this trick?

           Gombill just got ice arrows! He didn’t want to waste any extra bomb at all, so he buffered most of the weirdshot. Gombill now proceeds to get the bombchus, because he RBA’d poe before on, so he gets a total of 34 chus!

           As soon as Gombill gets caught, Ama is watching Sheik giving link some instructions about going to the forest to see the family… Boring. Gombill decides to man up and free the 4 gerudo fortress prisoners! Gerudo card is worth 5 points.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The torch strat never fails, the first prisoner is free. Ama is now ready to demolish his adult section, heading to kakariko in the first place.

           You probably guessed what is going to happen in the next 3 minutes, Gombill killing those guards while Ama is.. Getting his first HP from the kakariko cow! He doesn’t save warp tho, heading directly to the graveyard after getting the egg.

           <br/>
           It’s Dampe time! Gombill ground jumps to the third guard, which will give him some problems, the glitchless guard refuses to clip through the torch, but he finally finishes her off!

           <br/>
           It’s a 52 dampe for Ama! He then heads to shadow temple after getting the hookshot while Gombill is honored by the gerudo card!

           Gombill struggles a bit with the ground jump gerudo gate skip, throwing some bombs out here and there, but he finally gets to the desert,. Hover boots on, time to cross the wasteland. Wait, why is Ama going back and forth again and again on graveyard stairs? Wait, the Royal Tomb statue just disappeared! Sun’s song is worth 1 point and will help for skulltulas day/night cycles, well played Ama!

           Gombill is just in front of this race hardest trick, spirit hover. This is one of the nightmares of new players, let’s see how he handles it… He retargeted accidentally, luckily, the guay is away so he can keep hovering to the top, playing it really safely, floating on the air, waiting for the guay to disappear.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           While Gombill is suspended, Ama is buffering to get explosive quickdraw bottle on b, which also will takes a couple of tries. Oh no! Gombill fell down! Not over, though, remember he had 34 chus, he will try again. Very smoothly, very carefully, he reaches the Mirror Shield chest!

           Gombill decides to savewarp while ama just gets cojiro, how did Ama hatch the egg? Well, he got sun’s song! Gombill is now deciding what to do while getting Ganon Castle skull. Ama is a bit pissed off about failing explosive quickdraw bottle on b again, then buys green potion.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Gombill keeps farming skulls and hearts here and there while Ama enters DC. Seems like Gombill is heading out to DC too, but, does a turn, climbs up the mountain, and then falls down to the Roof HP! What a twisted result!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Gombill just entered DC while Ama is exiting it, after getting bombs. Ama is now attempting to hess all the way up to Goron City but some boulders doesn’t like speed. Ama then enters Goron City and leaves directly to Lost Woods, skips Mido and, you guessed it right, it's minuet time which is worth 3 points!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           No risks taken for Ama, death minuet skip while Gombill just opens the bomb chest, but wait… Gombill already had bombs, what is going on? Let me explain it to you, if you open the bomb chest while you already have the bomb bag, you will get a fake bomb bag over your bombchu slot, removing a point, if you had bombchus already equipped, you will be able to use them still!

           Ama is rushing to the desert area when we hit the 1 hour mark! Gombill just entered Goron City and heads to LW in order to grab minuet as well.

           Ama gets the skulls on Gerudo Valley, sun’s song paying off, of course. Meanwhile, Gombill is showing cojiro to the world while being hit by a bomb, it’s time to skip a minuet!

           Ama enters GTG using SVA’s clip, and attempts unbuffered weirdshot, having some trouble. After his 3rd try, he gets ice arrows! Gombill is heading to Deku Tree! Slingshot is worth 2 points.

           Ama is aware of the time left and decides to skip gerudo card, exiting his jail and heading to the wasteland. HESS through quicksand! No half wasteland HESS, though.

           Ama gets spirit hover first try! It took a while for Gombill to buy his deku shield, but there we go! Mirror shield for Ama after playing it safe, it’s worth 8+15 points!

           It’s really close! About 30 points for each player. Gombill decides to play minuet and enters Forest Temple while Ama is getting some skulls and here and there from the woods.

           Ama clips from Zora’s Domain to Lake Hylia while Gombill is doing the standard forest route up to bow. Ama just got bottle on b on the Lake and RBA’d ice arrows, we suspect he is going to enter Water Temple! If you didn’t know, RBA’ing ice arrows modifies your compass, map, and BK in water temple, so, Ama is going to be able to open the boss door for free!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Gombill just got the bow and is supersliding to lake hylia through Hyrule Field! Ama is having some trouble getting the compass in water temple while Gombill is swimming out of bounds to reach the Water Temple entrance.

           Ama is beating Morpha while Gombill decides to take advantage of his infinite keys and goes for longshot, which is worth 5 points because it removes your hookshot! Ama is done with water temple, he got the compass, the map, and beat morpha. If you didn’t see him getting the map, you didn’t study RBA tables enough!

           Uncertainty is the word for describing this final phase, we don’t know the exact score from Ama. Gombill is on 87, we will know the results once they post the score on the SRL channel.

           1 Minute left! Ama just got the slingshot and seems he is stops playing. Meanwhile, Gombill sure took those swindle classes, he’s duping bugs over and over and selling them for 50 rupees in Kakariko while the last seconds are going away!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Time! The audience is suspended, gombill finished on 92 points, what score will ama claim in the SRL channel? The tension is glowing….
           <br/>
           <br/>
           'So ama, what your points' The referee interrogates Ama.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           90! Says Ama.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Gombill takes the victory! It’s a 92 vs 90! David beat Goliath! The 16th player of the classification won the 1st! It was a really intense race, both players performed very well on choosing their objectives and items, outcoming in great combos like fake bomb bag to delete the bombchus + rba water temple keys for quick access to longshot + shield removal by Gombill. Or sun’s song by Ama which make him win a point.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The only big mistake for Gombill was spirit hover but Ama did more mistakes which lead him to do more resets, that probably cost him those 3 extra points. It was a really nice race though!
