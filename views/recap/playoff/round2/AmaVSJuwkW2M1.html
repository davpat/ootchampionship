           Here we go again! The winner’s second round is about to continue on this spectacular match between two stars!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The more we approach the end of the tournament, the less difference exists between matchups! Today we are going to witness 2 of the most brilliant oot players.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           France is represented by Amateseru and Belgium by Juwk, two countries that are next to each other! We also expect a really close match. How could we describe them?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Amateseru, the polyvalent runner, has shown us that he has no weaknesses. A beast that quickly adapts to any situation of the game.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Juwk is like… Amazing as well. Probably as skilled as Ama, i would say. He has the ability to learn stuff really fast, trust me. The only reason juwk finished 8th during the regular season is because he needs, that extra step, a tiny little thing that could push him into the olympus, being more confident.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           They are young, talented… Born for speedrunning, my friends. As i said, i’m willing to spectate this match, a new rivalry will be born.

           Ama picks the game mode, as he always will (unless he loses the first final) What do i expect to happen? Sincerely, i’ve no idea, but i will try:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           1. Ama will probably ban bingo if i have guess. Ama doesn’t lack of experience on bingo, but the problem is that Juwk is a veteran.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           2. Juwk banning categories is a thing that could happen here, but, it won’t. Let’s study why. The player who picks categories as a game mode will lose the category pick. That just means that picking categories is perjudicial for Ama since Juwk would simply pick All Dungeons. Juwk will probably ban the wheel at this point.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           3. Reached this far, Ama is going to ban short lockout or draft, he surely needs to eliminate any bingo related goal against Juwk.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           4. Juwk will ban countdown or maybe categories if he doesn’t feel confident enough? Hard to tell, i would say banning countdown is the good move here
           <br/>
           <br/>
           5. Ama has to choose between draft or categories, and he is going to pick draft to avoid playing no IM/WW or All Dungeons.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           That’s my guess! If i read the players correctly, this race will either be categories or a bingo variant. I honestly prefer draft, because if categories get picked, this report will end right now.

           It’s draft time! Ama chose draft over countdown because he doesn’t want to set up the stream. Will that decision fire back? Stay tuned…

           Crazy stuff on those picks! It seems like Juwk went for back in time while Ama goes for a single child to adult trip!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Let me point you something, Ama wrote “OH FUCK” after picking the 5 zora area HPs. I don’t exactly know why... He may thinks that he needs to go back in time for the frog HP? You can get 5 heart pieces without going back in time, those are:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           1. Zora’s Domain Chest
           <br/>
           <br/>
           2. 2x Zora’s River
           <br/>
           <br/>
           3. 2x Zora’s Fountain (needs iron boots)
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I’m also surprised 8 kakariko skulls was picked that much late, it is a pretty easy and fast goal, if you know how to superslide teleport as child, of course.

           Both players open the sword chest at the same time! Ama takes the lead while Juwk tries so hard to enter the hole back to the forest. It Seems like they are both going for the deku shield.

           <br/>
           Juwk bonks to the shop pot! They both get the WESS to pokey! Ama increases his lead by getting forest escape in the first try! Saria has a gift for both players, the fairy ocarina.

           If you didn’t know, Juwk could also skip the RBA sequence if the tries hard enough, by getting legit ZL. He could even skip back in time! “Putain de merde” claims Ama, seems like he is regretting his picks so far.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Who is going to get the WESS to Kak? Both! Ama gets it and Juwk proceeds to get it as well! Cuccos are about to get collected.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The good thing about both players being synchronized is that you can spot little differences between them. Did you know that Ama likes to backflip over the Kakariko stairs whereas Juwk prefers to sidehop? I personally, just walk over.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Their routes have been identical so far, sword, shield, ocarina and rushing to Kakariko! We could expect that they are both going for botw chus as well.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It is a 11:15 bottle for Ama and 11:18 bottle for Juwk! Navi diving to the well at the same time! Juwk takes it safe by jumping into the well and climbing up.

           Inside the well, they both get the ocarina dive without any trouble, of course. Juwk gets the botw chus 10 seconds after Ama! However, Juwk takes the lead afterwards because Ama needs to collect the compass inside there!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Ama savewarps out of the well while Juwk leaves Kakariko as fast as he can. Juwk is about to enter the Castle Area while Ama is about to enter Lost Woods!

           <br/>
           Juwk fails the damage boost to Zelda’s Courtyard and he is forced to do backup strats! In the meanwhile, Ama got nuts in ZD. It seems like he is going for Jabu as child; after getting ledge cancel, skips King Zora and moves on to the Fountain!

           I think i have a bit of sparse time to explain some things, finally. It seems like Juwk is going to skip back in time, getting all his child goals as child 1, maybe. The same goes for Ama. However, Juwk will be able to skip the RBA sequence as adult, he already has ZL.

           Ama is about to fight Barinade. Juwk, for the other part, just got the odd mushroom as child. He failed the megaflip once though! Perfection takes infinite time, according to physics.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Why is Juwk getting the mushroom, you might be wondering. Well, if you savewarp or die, the mushroom will turn into Cojiro, which you can RBA for a bomb bag and a quiver! Juwk heads to the Wasteland.

           As you can see, a player is also defined by the way the handle difficult situations. Some players would’ve just skipped getting the skull after having no method of obtaining ISG. Juwk is not an average player, though.

           Juwk savewarps after watching Sheik disappear in the sand while Ama gets his first Zora Area HP! Juwk escapes the forest using the ledge cancel method while Ama goes down the Zora’s River. Failing a HESS is not inside Juwk vocabulary.

           Juwk really nailed his child section. He did only 1 or 2 mistakes so far. We didn’t see Juwk getting kakariko skulls, though. We deduct he is going for back in time. Who actually is indeed getting those skulls is, however, Ama! We don’t quite understand the reason, so does Ama!

           Time for Juwk to narrate the story. As we predicted, Juwk got the poe in the Hyrule Field. RBA’ing that poe will modify your bombchus amount; keep in mind that it doesn't work with a big poe!

           But he didn’t stop there yet! Juwk also RBA’d cojiro, which is something that you normally end up getting if you keep in your inventory a mushroom for way too much. That gave Juwk a bomb bag and a quiver.

           Let me remark the current situation. Ama just had to leave fire temple after failing the block clip and he is now going to the zora area. In the meanwhile, Juwk just started his child 2 section by RBA’ing some extra bombchus in the forest.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Ama doesn’t give up, though. Never.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           After getting Saria’s song and beating the skull kill, Juwk is almost done, heading to Goron City and about to get his last 2 skulls on the mountains. Ama just cleaned the Zora’s River section and he is about to enter the Fountain.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Juwk is so fast he is way early before entering Kakariko!

           That’s all folks! Juwk gets the first win of this matchup with a 1:51:54 after playing almost perfectly (Ice Cavern) Ama did way too many mistakes and he was left behind, but, this is not over, not by far. See you in the next match!
