           It is 2018 and we keep going! Welcome everybody to the beginning of the losers bracket, a second chance for the players that lost a round on the main bracket.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Today we are about to witness, from my point of view, the real battle between N64 and VC. On my left, Chris, number #14 on the SRL boards. An experienced and polyvalent N64 runner that knows the game like the back of his hand. And, on my right, Scara, number #15 on the SRL boards, having the exact same description than Chris but playing on VC!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           That’s why i believe this matchup is also between consoles; these two players are almost identical! I’m not only talking about their skill, they also share a common downside (I hope they forgive me for this) They seem to be clueless. They sometimes miss a routing option, an item, something that they could’ve done… It’s ok, unlike Tob, we are all humans. The good point about this is that, they tend to realize their mistakes later on, so that’s a way to keep improving!

           Let’s move on to the banning phase. Yes, the first match of a round will always include a banning phase between modes, and i’m going to guess what’s going to happen:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           1. Scara will almost for sure ban categories on his first pick, i can’t really see him banning any other thing here. Most of the OCS matchups banned pretty early this mode if one of the players was an active RTA runner.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           2. I think Chris will ban short lockout here. I’ve never seem Chris practising child bingos. Besides that, N64 has a pretty disadvantage with VC with early goals that doesn’t require explosives. Chris already banned Short Lockout against Hyperion, and i believe he will do it again against Scara.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           3. Scara has to choose between banning Bingo, Draft , Countdown or the Wheel at this point. I believe he will ban Bingo, but i’m not sure at all, mind games could start happening.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           4. Chris will then either ban the wheel or draft. We need to remember that Chris banned draft against Hyperion during his first match. However, that probably was a well made decision because Hyperion’s strongest point is routing a huge set of objectives. I personally believe Chris will ban the Wheel here to remove the luck factor.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           5. Between Draft or Countdown, i would say Scara can pick either one, can’t really see a huge difference between these two.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           All said, now we are going to wait for the players to make the real banning phase. You will see if i did my homework, correctly analysing players, or if i’m totally wrong. The banning stage could go in different ways but this match is going to be a mode between Bingo, Draft or Countdown. It is now time to wait for the sunset to come in Europe…

           The race starts! After around 20 minutes from creating the room, both players did their respective picks and the hype begins! We’ve seen some blocking strats from both players.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Chris attempted to block Scara from having all forest temple goals by picking the 5 keys inside it.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The most relevant issue is that Scara picked the option of back in time as soon as he could (Defeat PG) However, Chris wanted to do an all adult run but got forced into picking 7 magic beans and all 8 Mountain skulls.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           There are also several synergised goals for both players, like the knuckles for Chris or 5 Lake Hylia skulls and fire arrows for Scara (Forest Trial)
           <br/>
           <br/>
           We can describe Chris route as No ZL with a notable child section. And we can describe Scara’s route as mainly owned by back in time and forced ZL.

           The intro cutscene is over! Chris heads directly to the sword while Scara bonks to the kokiri shop, then buys a single stick! Scara is going to rush his way to Adult, mostly because he can complete all his child goals after going back in time!

           Chris is entering the shop while Scara gets to escape the forest on his 3rd try! He went 1 frame late and 1 frame early, on the jump slash through the pillar. If you were wondering, the  deku stick doesn’t break if you have a good angle, so you can repeat as many times as you want.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Chris just bought 1 stick and 1 set of nuts, in that time, Scara is struggling to get the WESS to Kakariko, losing his stick. Scara backwalks to Kakariko while it’s now Chris turn to escape the forest.

           Chris heads to the Zora River while Scara finished farming his bombs on the grave. Scara is now climbing DMT up on his way  to DC, he needs the map and compass there.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Chris buys the 6th magic bean and immediately leaves the river. It is usually better to farm the big money away from the river while doing other things related to your bingo goals. Chris heads to Kakariko and, using the best item in the game, bombchus, opens the redead grotto and gets the 200 rupee chest!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara just got the map &amp; compass in DC, that’s his first goal! While Chris has a nice talk with the owl near Kakariko, Scara enters Goron City and takes the shortcut to the Lost Woods! Chris buys his last bean at the time Scara trades cojiro for the odd mushroom!

           We wrote a lot about Chris so far
           <s>
            because he is more interesting
           </s>
           Because Scara mostly did the normal RBA sequence up to saw, which you will probably see in about 50% of the OCS races. In my opinion, i would prefer if bingos in general would reward a bit more doing child stuff, in order to avoid bingos being an “auto-mode” thing up to RBA saw.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara just traded the potion for the saw in Lost Woods. He is now ready for another round, the real fight, versus his nemesis, the goron named after our hero, UI! Scara skips the goron tunic and heads directly to the crater by clipping into darunia’s room!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So far it’s a 2-1 for Chris. We will see how things develop in the closest future…

Be sure to check stick as adult on ZSR (But not on google images) To get more information about it.

           It is a 7-6 for Chris the moment Scara enters the Fire Temple! Chris has just entered Ganon’s Castle area and he’s about to hover to the entrance!

           Chris doesn’t seem confident about his chances, he surely did more mistakes than Scara, but i believe Chris goals are faster than Scara ones; Forest Trial is just… Forest Trial.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Chris enters the castle and successfully skips the barrier on his 2nd try! Scara is on his way, climbing fire temple up. Having 6 hearts, heat timers mean nothing to him.

           Chris is about to fight the Iron Knuckles!

           Chris is now heading to the desert area, rushing to the Spirit Temple. Scara is almost done with the gorons, his heroic spirit never ends! Scara gets the hammer!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Lets recapitulate about what is reminding. Chris needs to clear Spirit and Forest temples, after that, he will be done! Scara, by the other hand, will need to complete 2 trials and then perform back in time to complete all his child goals.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Chris is about to start the spirit hover!  He gets to the Silver Gauntlets chest on the first try! After that, he enters the temple for safety and superslides to mirror shield! By that time, Scara finished to release all the gorons, playing prelude afterwards.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It is a 7-7 the moment Scara is about to start the Ganon’s Castle hover. We need to remember that Chris has the fairy goal currently unmarked, so far he had to unmark it 2 times.

           Nothing special happened during this section. Scara got the hover to the Trials and Chris is about to start Spirit BK Skip (The hard version of it) He is blessed by blinkzy RNG, though, getting 3 bombs out of 4 armos. “Thanks Blinkzy”, he claims.

           Seems like the gravity doesn’t want to cooperate with Scara during his journey on the Forest Trial. By the other hand, Chris nailed the Spirit BK skip and the Nabooru Fight, he is now about to collect his unused key inside Spirit Temple.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Chris plays minuet the moment Scara finishes his Trials section! It is a 9-9! It is coming way too close!

           Chris just needs to collect all forest temple keys and, it will be game! Scara is about to start his back in time journey, he needs 3 skulls on the lake, 4 skulls on ZD, and ruto’s letter (he has a fake scale)

           Seems like they are both struggling a bit. Chris with block of time ledge clip, Scara with Adult DoT skip.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara realized that he needs a shield for 1 skull in Zora’s Fountain! He savewarps and buys it from the kokiri shop. At that moment, Chris already has 4 keys, he just needs the one after bow, will his game suffer the new, fancy, bubble crash? Seems like he got lucky!

           Chris kills the stalfos! Scara just played Serenade after getting Zora’s River skulls! We can’t really see Scara winning in this position, unless Chris dies to the poe or something.

           Chris gets the first win! Besides having more wheelchair moments than Scara, he did pretty well during the moments of tension. I believe Chris did a better picking overall, 7 beans was bad, but not as bad after all. Scara played better but his goals were more sparse, plus having the ZL requirement which forced him to RBA up until Saw.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Following with tradition, Scara always finishes the races even if he loses!

           They decide to keep going and it seems that they are about to play the second match just after this one!

           Scara picks bingo!
           <br/>

           I won’t be reporting this match because i’m pretty exhausted but here’s a summary.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Everything went well until Chris forgot to RBA cojiro.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Scara wins! It’s a tie! Chris will pick the last battle mode on the tiebreaker, see you until then!
